<p>
    Decrypto is a light-weight python package to provide state of the art encryption and decryption techniques and aims to be simple and easy to use. Being open-source, Decrypto wraps a huge number of old, modern, secure and encoding based encryption-decryption methods while still being fast<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It's light-weight and fast</li>
    <li>Simple to use and learn</li>
    <li>Provides a multidegree of techniques from various cryptographic field</li>
</ul>

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install decrypto.

```bash
pip install decrypto
```

## Usage

You can either use a classical cipher technique

```python
from decrypto import MorseCodeCipher

cipher = MorseCodeCipher()
data = 'Hello World'

# encrypt using morse code cipher
encrypted = cipher.encrypt(data)
print(encrypted)

# decrypt using morse code cipher
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)
print(decrypted)
```

or a more advanced and modern cipher technique

```python
from decrypto import RSACipher

cipher = RSACipher()
data = 'hello world'

keys = cipher.generate_keys(23, 31)
encrypted = cipher.encrypt(message, keys['public_key'])
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted, keys['private_key'])

print(keys)
print(encrypted)
print(decrypted)
```
